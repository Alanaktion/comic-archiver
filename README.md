# comic-archiver

This is a project to build simplistic archive tools for a large number of
webcomics. I'm doing this mostly because I've had too many comics I love
disappear with no reasonable way of finding them again.

Completed comics in particular are important to archive, because no matter how
good they are and how much people love them, they disappear a lot more often
than active ones.

## Usage

Archive comics by simply running `php <name>.php` on the comic you want to
archive. Most of these tools are also designed to be able to be run fairly
regularly and only download the new images for active comics.
